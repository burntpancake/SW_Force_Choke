Force Choke is a mutation mod aim to let players cosplay a badass Jedi/Sith Warrior by using the famous Force choke.

You can use the Force to squeeze a victim's throat continuously, doing so requires one free hand. 
Your victim may break free each turn by passing a toughness save, or getting out of range. 
Force choked targets will receive increasing damage based on the turns they are choked, and move 30% slower.
Use another mental ability or missile weapons will disrupt your maintain of the force, ending the effect.
Force choke can only be applied to humanoids and animals that need to breathe through a chokable throat, e.g. It will not be applicable to bugs, spiders, fish or robots.

Note:
Maintaining the Force gesture will loosen your tightened carapace.

Given that you cannot maintain the choking if you use another mental ability or missile weapon, it is advised that you engage in melee with your enemy after you use force choke, preferably with your favorite lightsaber.

Fight like a true Jedi/Sith!
