Force Choke is a mutation mod aim to let players cosplay a badass Jedi/Sith Warrior by using the famous Force choke.

You can use the Force to squeeze a victim's throat continuously, doing so requires one free hand. 
Your vitim may break free each turn by passing a toughness save, or getting out of range. 
While maintaing the Force Choke gesture, you may NOT use another ability or missile weapons. 
While being Force choked, the vitim is also slowed.
Force choke can only be applied to humanoids and animals.


Note:
Maintaining the Force gesture will losen your tightened carapace.
